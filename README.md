## üöÄ What is it?

**Spring Boot Tor Starter** is an auto-configuration library that:

- Automatically generates the `torrc` configuration file
- Creates a Tor hidden service directory (with proper permissions)
- Starts the Tor process in the background
- Reads and exposes the generated `.onion` address from the `hostname` file

No need to manually edit `torrc`, configure ports, or handle service directories.  
Just include the dependency and enable Tor in your `application.properties`.
